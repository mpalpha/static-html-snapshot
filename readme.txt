== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work locally on Windows? =

No, sorta. This plugin has been tested and works locally with Linux or Unix - but by all means, give it a go with wget for Windows (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) and see what happens.
Mac OS X users need wget installed - here's a guide: http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/22/install-wget-mac-os-x/
